# Workshops-22-23
Workshops materials for the University of Southampton Artificial Intelligence Society


## Workshop - 6: Introduction to Neural Networks
Go to the /6-NN/ folder and just load up the ipynb file.

Loading up an ipynb file:
* Google Collaboratory (EASIEST): https://colab.research.google.com/. **Make sure to upload BOTH the .ipynb file and the .csv file**
* Using VSCode: VSCode already has an extension called "Jupyter" which will load the Jupyter file for you however you'd need to have tensorflow, seaborn and pandas installed already. If you have pip installed, `pip install tensorflow pandas seaborn` will do the job.

## Workshop - 7: Recurrent Neural Networks
With the rising electricity prices, its important we know the cheapest times to use electricity.
We'll need to harness the power of RNN to accurately predict this into the future!

All code is in "electricity_forecast.ipynb" in the folder "/7 - RNN".

- Use "git clone https://github.com/aisoc/Workshops-22-23.git"
- OR upload the file to https://colab.research.google.com/
